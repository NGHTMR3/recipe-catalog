# Arepas de Queso

## Ingredients

* 2 cups precooked cornmeal (masarepa, P.A.N.)
* 2 Tbsp butter
* 2.5 cups hot water
* 1 package Queso Fresco
* Cooking Oil

## Procedure

* In a bowl, mix the precooked cornmeal, salt and butter.

* Add the warm water, a little bit at a time, mixing it into the cornmeal mixture with a spoon first and then your hands when the dough starts to form.

* Add the cheese and keep mixing the cornmeal masa with your hands.

* Let the cornmeal masa rest for 15 minutes.

* When the masa is smooth and easy to work with, shape small chunks into little balls, about 2 inches wide each.

* Flatten the sides slightly with your hands. Using your palms and fingers, pat each one into the classic arepa shape: about 1/2 inch thick and 4 inches across.

* Pour the oil into a large frying pan. Over medium-high heat, fry the arepas in batches, being careful not to overcrowd. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes and then flip them. Fry the second side for another 2 to 3 minutes.

* When both sides are a beautiful golden-brown color, your arepa is done!
