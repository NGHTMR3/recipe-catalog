## INGREDIENTS
SERVINGS: 12 MINI CHEESECAKES

### FOR THE GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST:

1 cup (120 grams) graham cracker crumbs
3 tablespoons (40 grams) granulated sugar
3 and 1/2 tablespoons (50 grams) unsalted butter melted

### FOR THE CHEESECAKE FILLING:

16 ounces (452 grams) brick-style cream cheese softened to room temperature
1/3 cup (80 grams) sour cream room temperature
1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 large eggs room temperature

## Procedure 
### TO MAKE THE GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST:

Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line a 12-count muffin pan with cupcake liners and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs and sugar. Add the melted butter and mix until all of the crumbs are moistened. Evenly distribute the mixture between all 12 liners and firmly press it down into one even layer.

Bake at 325°F (163°C) for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Keep oven temperature at 325°F (163°C).

### TO MAKE THE CHEESECAKE FILLING:
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, mix the cream cheese and sour cream together until smooth and creamy. Add the sugar and vanilla extract and mix until fully combined, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Mix in the eggs, one at a time, on low speed until just combined.

Evenly distribute the batter between all 12 liners in the cupcake pan, filling each one almost all the way to the top.

Bake at 325°F (163°C) for 17-20 minutes or until the tops of the cheesecakes are set.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan for 1 hour. Carefully remove from the pan and chill in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours or overnight.

### NOTES
Store leftover mini cheesecakes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.Freezing Instructions: Mini cheesecakes will freeze well for up to 3 months, thaw overnight in the refrigerator.Graham Cracker Crumbs: To make this recipe a little easier, you can use store-bought graham cracker crumbs. If you're crushing your own graham crackers, you'll need about 8 full-sheets to get 1 cup of crumbs.Cream Cheese: Make sure to use bricks of cream cheese and not cream cheese spread in a tub. I recommend using full-fat cream cheese for the best results.Sour Cream: Full-fat sour cream works best in this recipe. You may also replace the sour cream with an equal amount of plain Greek yogurt.Eggs: If you forget to set your eggs out ahead of time, simply place them in a bowl of warm water for 5-10 minutes to bring them to room temperature.
