# Hawaiian Style Macaroni Salad

## Ingredients

* ¼ pound dried elbow macaroni pasta
* ½ cup Best Foods mayonnaise
* ¼ cup onion, grated
* ¼ cup carrots, shredded
* ¼ cup celery, finely diced
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon pepper

## Procedure 

1. Cook the elbow macaroni pasta for 1-2 minutes more than the cook time listed on the package. Drain and set aside.
2. Place the elbow macaroni in a bowl and mix in the mayonnaise, grated onions, shredded carrots, finely diced celery, salt, and pepper.
3. Refrigerate the dish at least an hour - this allows the flavors to mix. Serve slightly chilled (remove from the refrigerator 10 minutes before serving) as a side dish. Enjoy!
